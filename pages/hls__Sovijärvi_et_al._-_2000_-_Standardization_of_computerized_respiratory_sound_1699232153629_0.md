- The effect that, after sampling, a harmonic function appears to manifest another frequency. This occurs if the frequency of the original continuous harmonic signal is higher than half the sampling rate. The apparent frequency is equal to the smallest distance of the original frequency to any integer multiple of the sampling rate. For example, if the sampling rate is 1 kHz, a sampled harmonic signal of 800 Hz will appear to have a frequency of 200 Hz; a sampled harmonic signal of 1,000 Hz will appear to have a frequency of 0 Hz (a constant value); a sampled harmonic signal of 5,100 Hz will appear to have a frequency of 100 Hz. In general, for arbitrary signals, the spectrum should be zero above half the sampling rate. All frequency components above this frequency (the Nyquist frequency) will be "aliased", and this corrupts the actual original components in the base band [11].

- A microphone in which the metallic diaphragm is positioned in parallel to a ﬁxed electrode, in such a way that an electric condenser is formed. The incident sound wave displaces the diaphragm and thereby causes electrical capacitance variations. These capacitance variations may be converted to voltage variations. For example, by applying a direct current (DC) voltage to the electrodes through a high resistance. [7]

- A deformation of the input signal to a system, detected at its output due to nonlinear behaviour of some system component, sometimes induced by strong interference signal (intermodulation distortion). The distortion can be measured in the time domain as lack of linearity or in the complex domain as harmonic distortion and/or phase distortion [34].

When combined with a suitable transistor circuit and an energizing battery, it forms a small, highly sensitive microphone. The output commonly includes a DC offset voltage. [8, 35].

- The response of a system to harmonic (sinusoidal) excitation of varying frequency. For linear time invariant dynamic systems, if a harmonic signal is presented at the input, a harmonic signal of the same frequency occurs at the output (after the decay of a transient phenomenon). Therefore, the steady-state response for every frequency can be represented by two numbers: the input-to-output amplitude ratio and the input-to-output phase difference[46, 47].

It is constituted by all the continuous (and generally small) temporal oscillations of the instants of switching around their mean values. In sound analysis, it measures pitch perturbation, i.e. the variation in fundamental frequency (F0) [49].
