- The dynamic microphone’s main disadvantage is its narrow bandwidth, since a single dynamic membrane does not linearly respond to all audio frequencies and may introduce distortions in different regions of the frequency spectrum.

- There is a specific type of condenser microphone that is called the electret microphone where the externally applied charge is replaced by a permanent charge in an electret material, which is a ferroelectric material that has been permanently electrically charged.

- Due to their good performance, ease of manufacture, and relatively lower cost, electret microphones are widely used in instrumentation. They have almost flat frequency response over the audio frequency range and are quite stable. They do not require an external polarizing voltage but are produced with an integrated preamplifier that requires power.

- When used in pulmonary sound recording, the diaphragm and the chest wall need to be coupled acoustically through a closed air cavity since the movements involved are very small

- However, later studies by Pasterkamp et al. [14] have found that both sensors have similar frequency response and signal-to-noise ratio in the frequency range of respiratory signals.

- Contact sensors: If a piezoelectric accelerometer is used, then coupling is directly on the skin, since it is a contact sensor. There is no need for an air coupler, but the pressure exerted on the skin through the sensor should be kept constant. Maintaining constant pressure is difficult to achieve manually. The use of elastic bands is not suitable, since the pressure between the sensor and the skin varies as thorax moves with breathing. Adhesive rings are suggested to be used for contact sensor attachments.

- In recording breath sounds, there are basically two major approaches:1. “Contact sensor” for direct recording of the movement of the chest wall (e.g., piezoelectric accelerometer)2. “Air-coupled sensor” for acoustic recording of the movement of a diaphragm exposed to the air pressure generated by the chest-wall movement (e.g., condenser, in particular, electret microphone)

- Condenser microphones: There is a need of an air coupler that is used with the condenser microphone since free-field measurement is not possible for such small movements of the chest wall involved in respiratory sounds.
